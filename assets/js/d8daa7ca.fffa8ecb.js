This method applies to sidecar containers that do not affect the Pod service availability, such as the log collection agent. However, for sidecar containers acting as a proxy such as Istio Envoy, this upgrade method is defective. Envoy, as a proxy container in the Pod, handles all the traffic. If users restart and upgrade directly, service availability will be affected. Thus, you need a complex grace termination and coordination mechanism to upgrade the envoy sidecar separately.
